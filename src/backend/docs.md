# src/backend

Assuming that I will be throwing requests to the backend server in the future, I described `dto` and `enum` to define the specifications with the backend.

- `/services`: Services for the **Presentation layer**. Not used this time, but provided as a sample to throw a request from the front end if there is a backend server. In the future, services that call the backend from the frontend will be described here.
