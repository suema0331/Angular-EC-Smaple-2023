Save images.
 (As a side note) Many of the images used in this application were taken during my previous solo trip to Germany as a backpacker :)

- `./swagger/openapi.yaml`: I have defined [openapi.yaml](https://d1p9q3d57rp82y.cloudfront.net/swagger) as a sample. When migrating to a RESTful API with a backend, the types described in Swagger can be used to make communication with the backend more robust, allowing for a smooth transition.
In addition, `open-api-generater` can be used to automatically generate front-end DTOs and services.
Right now I only have a sample, but I would like to define all types. :)
